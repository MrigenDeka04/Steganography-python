# Steganography-python
This project demonstrates an image steganography tool implemented in Python. It allows users to securely hide and retrieve messages within images using a passcode for encryption and decryption. The application provides a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) built with tkinter and uses OpenCV for image manipulation.
